## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark grayish blue (#4A6572) to convey professionalism and trust.
- Background color: Very dark grayish blue (#232F34) for a modern, sophisticated feel.
- Accent color: Moderate purplish blue (#61892F) to highlight key elements and call to action buttons.
- Body text and Headlines: 'Inter', a sans-serif for a clean and readable interface. Use a slightly larger font size for better readability.
- Use a consistent set of glyph-style icons, primarily in the accent color. Icons should represent common concepts related to data and cybersecurity (e.g., database, network, lock, chart).
- Use a clean, well-structured layout with clear visual hierarchy. Divide content into logical sections with sufficient white space for readability. Consider using a grid-based system for alignment.
- Use subtle animations to enhance user experience. For example, project cards can subtly animate on hover to reveal more information.  Use smooth transitions for page changes.
